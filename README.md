This project analyzes biodiversity patterns across counties using a cleaned species-level dataset. The goal is to understand how total species richness relates to the number of rare or at-risk species, and to build predictive models that estimate rarity based on basic ecological variables. The project follows a structured workflow:

• Data cleaning and preparation
• Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in richness and rarity
• Statistical inference using bootstrapping to test ecological hypotheses
• Predictive modeling with linear regression and ridge regression
• Model evaluation using cross validation and RMSE

The main question tested in the inference section is whether counties with higher total species richness also support more rare species. The prediction section builds models that estimate rare species counts using variables such as total richness and the proportion of rare species.
